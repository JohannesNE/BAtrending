## Compare results with those from an analysis on absolute scale

To compare results from an analysis on log transformed measurements with an analysis on absolute (non-transformed) measurements, the SD of differences of $log_e$ measurements ($D_{log} = log(CO_{alt}) - log(CO_{ref})$) is comparable to the SD of differences on raw measurements ($D$) relative to the mean of the measurements:

$$
SD(D_{log}) \approx \frac{SD(D)}{mean(CO_{alt}, CO_{ref})},
$$

when $SD < \sim0.2$.
